In 'Lesson 2: Guidelines' of the 'ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers' course, Isa Fulford presents two key principles for effective prompt engineering. The first principle is to provide clear and specific instructions, and she goes over four tactics for achieving this, including using delimiters to indicate distinct parts of the input and asking for a structured output. The second principle is to give the model time to think, and Isa discusses two ways to do this, including instructing the model to work out its own solution first before rushing to a conclusion. Isa also highlights some limitations of language models, such as the risk of hallucinations, and suggests a tactic to reduce this risk when generating answers based on a text.
