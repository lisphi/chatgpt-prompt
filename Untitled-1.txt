The video presents guidelines for effective prompting, including two key principles: writing clear and specific instructions and giving the model time to think. Viewers will use OpenAI's chat GPT model and the chat completion's endpoint, and a helper function called getCompletion is defined to make it easier to use prompts and look at generated outputs. The first principle discussed is to write clear and specific instructions to guide the model towards the desired output and reduce the chance of irrelevant or incorrect responses. The second principle is to give the model time to think and to request a chain or series of relevant reasoning if the model is making reasoning errors. The text discusses how breaking down tasks into steps can help improve the accuracy of large language models and suggests using techniques to avoid issues such as "hallucinating." The video concludes by introducing the iterative prompt development process.
