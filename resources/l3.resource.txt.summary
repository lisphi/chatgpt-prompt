Lesson 3: Iterative - In this lesson, Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng discuss the iterative process of developing a good prompt for an application through refining and testing. They demonstrate an example of developing a prompt for summarizing a fact sheet for a chair by running the code multiple times, making changes to the prompt, and seeing how the output varies. They also explain that the key to being an effective prompt engineer is having a good process and iteratively developing an effective prompt for the application instead of relying on a perfect prompt. Additionally, they discuss the importance of keeping various best practices in mind while developing a prompt and the need to evaluate prompts against a larger set of examples for more mature applications.
