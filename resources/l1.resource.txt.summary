In this lesson, Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford introduce the course on ChatGPT prompt engineering for developers. They discuss the power of large language models (LLMs) for developers using API calls and how it can quickly build software applications. They also explain the two types of LLMs: base LLMs and instruction tuned LLMs, with the latter being recommended for most practical applications today. Andrew and Isa cover the best practices for prompting with instruction tuned LLMs and emphasize the importance of being clear and specific with instructions and giving LLMs time to think. The course also includes building a chatbot using an LLM and examples of common use cases. The materials were developed with contributions from teams at OpenAI and DeepLearning.ai.
